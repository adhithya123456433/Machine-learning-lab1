  E‑commerce sales data exploration and top-product analysis.  
  Description: Loads the "ecommerce-data" CSV, inspects structure and missing values, computes summary statistics and per-product sales, and visualizes the top products (bar and line plots). Intended to demonstrate basic data cleaning, grouping/aggregation, and plotting for retail transaction data. The notebook uses pandas/numpy/matplotlib and contains code to download the dataset with kagglehub.

- SCENARIO_2_Hospital_Patient_Records
  Patient records (Pima Indians diabetes) exploratory analysis.  
  Description: Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to perform EDA: prints head/info/describe, inspects distributions and spread (histogram of Glucose, boxplot of Age, etc.). Useful for demonstrating clinical dataset inspection and basic single-variable visualizations. Dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib. Dataset in the notebook.

- scenario_3_housing
  Housing dataset — EDA, scatter plots and correlation heatmap.  
  Description: Loads, shows dataset schema and summary statistics, checks for missing values, plots Area vs Price scatter and a numeric-feature correlation heatmap. Designed to illustrate feature relationships and simple visual diagnostics prior to modeling. Dependencies: pandas, matplotlib.

- SCENARIO_4_Banking_Customer_Data
  Customer personality / marketing campaign data exploration.  
  Description: Loads the marketing campaign dataset presents head/info/describe, lists missing values, and includes various descriptive statistics and visual checks. Demonstrates customer-level EDA useful for segmentation and response modeling tasks. The notebook includes a dataset download step but also reads the file from a Kaggle input path.
